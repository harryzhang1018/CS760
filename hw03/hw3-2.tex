\section{Questions (50 pts)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item (9 pts) Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem. And, provide the number of data points ($n$) and the number of features ($p$).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (3 pts) We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in predicting CEO salary with given factors.
	
	\begin{soln} \\
	This is a regression because we are trying to give prediction whose output is in continuous space. \\
	Number of data: 500; Number of features: 3 (profit, number of employees, industry) \end{soln}
	
	\item (3 pts) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	This is the classification problem because we are trying to predict the output in discrete space (either this product will be success or failure)\\
	Number of data: 20; Number of features: 13 (price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables)
	\end{soln}
	
	\item (3 pts) We are interesting in predicting the \% change in the US dollar in relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For each week we record the \% change in the dollar, the \% change in the US market, the \% change in the British market, and the \% change in the German market.
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	This is a regression problem because we are trying to predict the output in continuous space (percentage change in dollar).\\
	Number of data: 52 (Assume: 4 weeks/month and 12 months in 2012); Number of features: 3 (\% change in the US market, the \% change in the British market, and the \% change in the German market)
	\end{soln}
	
\end{enumerate}

\item (6 pts) The table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ c  c  c  c}
		\hline
		$X_{1}$ & $X_{2}$ & $X_{3}$ & $Y$ \\ \hline
		0 & 3 & 0 & Red \\
		2 & 0 & 0 & Red \\
		0 & 1 & 3 & Red \\
		0 & 1 & 2 & Green \\
		-1 & 0 & 1 & Green \\
		1 & 1 & 1 & Red  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Suppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for $Y$ when $X_{1} = X_{2} = X_{3} = 0$ using K-nearest neighbors.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2 pts) Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, $X_{1} = X_{2} = X_{3}=0$.
 
	\begin{soln}\\
	If we using Euclidean distance, then the distance between each observation and the test point is in the following chart: \\
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ c  c  c  c}
			\hline
			$X_{1}$ & $X_{2}$ & $X_{3}$ & Distance to point $(X_{1}=X_{2}=X_{3}=0)$ \\ \hline
			0 & 3 & 0 & 3 \\
			2 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
			0 & 1 & 3 & $\sqrt{10}$ \\
			0 & 1 & 2 & $\sqrt{5}$ \\
			-1 & 0 & 1 & $\sqrt{2}$ \\
			1 & 1 & 1 & $\sqrt{3}$  \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\end{soln}
 
	\item (2 pts) What is our prediction with $K=1$? Why?
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	If we use $K=1$, then the prediction is Green because the nearest point is the fifth observation $(X_1 =-1, X_2 = 0, X_3 = 1)$, which is Green. \\
	\end{soln}
	
	\item (2 pts) What is our prediction with $K=3$? Why?
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	If we use $K=3$, then the prediction is Red because the nearest three points are the fifth observation $(X_1 =-1, X_2 = 0, X_3 = 1)$, the sixth observation $(X_1 =1, X_2 = 1, X_3 = 1)$, and the second observation $(X_1 =2, X_2 = 0, X_3 = 0)$, which are two Red and one Green (Red is dominate prediction here).
	\end{soln}

\end{enumerate}

\item (12 pts) When the number of features $p$ is large, there tends to be a deterioration in the performance of KNN and other local approaches that perform prediction using only observations that are near the test ob- servation for which a prediction must be made. This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality, and it ties into the fact that non-parametric approaches often perform poorly when $p$ is large.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2pts) Suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on $p=1$ feature, $X$. We assume that $X$ is uniformly (evenly) distributed on [0, 1]. Associated with each observation is a response value. Suppose that we wish to predict a test observation’s response using only observations that are within 10\% of the range of $X$ closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with $X=0.6$, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65]. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	Since the total range of $X$ is 1, and we only use 10\% of the range of $X$ closest to the test observation, then the range of $X$ we use is 0.1. Therefore, the fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction is 0.1.
	\end{soln}
	
	
	\item (2pts) Now suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on $p =2$ features, $X1$ and $X2$. We assume that predict a test observation’s response using only observations that $(X1,X2)$ are uniformly distributed on [0, 1] × [0, 1]. We wish to are within 10\% of the range of $X1$ and within 10\% of the range of $X2$ closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with $X1 =0.6$ and $X2 =0.35$, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65] for $X1$ and in the range [0.3, 0.4] for $X2$. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	Based on answer in part (a), we know that the fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction for $X1$ is 0.1. Similarly, the fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction for $X2$ is 0.1. Therefore, the fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction for $(X1,X2)$ is $0.1^2 = 0.01$.
	\end{soln}
	
	\item (2pts) Now suppose that we have a set of observations on $p = 100$ features. Again the observations are uniformly distributed on each feature, and again each feature ranges in value from 0 to 1. We wish to predict a test observation’s response using observations within the 10\% of each feature’s range that is closest to that test observation. What fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	Since the total range of each feature is 1, and we only use 10\% of the range of each feature closest to the test observation, then the range of each feature we use is 0.1. Therefore, the fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction is $0.1^{100}$.
	\end{soln}
	
	\item (3pts) Using your answers to parts (a)–(c), argue that a drawback of KNN when p is large is that there are very few training observations “near” any given test observation.
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	We can write expression for available fraction of observations when $p$ is large as following:$\underset{p \to \infty}{\lim} 0.1^p = 0$, which means, as p goes very large, the fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction is very small. Therefore, there are very few training observations “near” any given test observation.
	\end{soln}
	
	\item (3pts) Now suppose that we wish to make a prediction for a test observation by creating a $p$-dimensional hypercube centered around the test observation that contains, on average, 10\% of the training observations. For $p =$1, 2, and 100, what is the length of each side of the hypercube? Comment what happens to the length of the sides as $\lim_{{p \to \infty}}$.
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	For $p=1$, the hypercube is just a line segment with length of 0.1 (as shown in part (a)); for $p=2$, the hypercube is a 2D square whose area is 0.1 of the total available observation, herein length for each side is $\sqrt{0.1}$. If we make this statement more general, when feature is $p$, length for each side is $0.1^{\frac{1}{p}}$. When p is large: length = $\lim_{{p \to \infty}} 0.1^{\frac{1}{p}} = 1$. Intuitively, it means to get 10\% of data when $p$ is approaching infinity, we need to include all training set.\\
	\end{soln}
	
\end{enumerate}

\item (6 pts) Supoose you trained a classifier for a spam detection system. The prediction result on the test set is summarized in the following table.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l l | l l}
		&          & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Predicted class} \\
		&          & Spam           & not Spam           \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{Actual class} & Spam     & 8              & 2                  \\
		& not Spam & 16             & 974               
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Calculate
\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2 pts) Accuracy
	\begin{soln}\\
	Accuracy = $\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} = \frac{8 + 974}{8 + 974 + 16 + 2} = 0.98$
	\end{soln}
	\item (2 pts) Precision
	\begin{soln}\\
	Precision = $\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{8}{8 + 16} = 0.33$
	\end{soln}
	\item (2 pts) Recall
	\begin{soln}\\
	Recall = $\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \frac{8}{8 + 2} = 0.8$
	\end{soln}
\end{enumerate}


\item (9pts) Again, suppose you trained a classifier for a spam filter. The prediction result on the test set is summarized in the following table. Here, "+" represents spam, and "-" means not spam.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c  c }
\hline
Confidence positive & Correct class \\ \hline
0.95 & + \\
0.85 & + \\
0.8 & - \\
0.7 & + \\
0.55 & + \\
0.45 & - \\
0.4 & + \\
0.3 & + \\
0.2 & - \\
0.1 & - \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (6pts) Draw a ROC curve based on the above table.
	
	\begin{soln}
	See the Fig.~\ref{fig:roc}.
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/ROC_q1_5.png}
		\caption{ROC curve}
		\label{fig:roc}
	\end{figure}
	\end{soln}
	
	\item (3pts) (Real-world open question) Suppose you want to choose a threshold parameter so that mails with confidence positives above the threshold can be classified as spam. Which value will you choose? Justify your answer based on the ROC curve.
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	I prefer to choose the threshold as 0.3 because this maximizes the true positive rate (TPR) while minimizing the false positive rate (FPR).This means I want as much true spam detection as possible, while I don't care too much about the false spam detection (if someone tries to reach out for important things, I can get this information through phone call or text or other ways).
	\end{soln}
\end{enumerate}

\item (8 pts) In this problem, we will walk through a single step of the gradient descent algorithm for logistic regression. As a reminder,
$$\hat{y} = f(x, \theta)$$
$$f(x;\theta) = \sigma(\theta^\top x)$$
$$\text{Cross entropy loss } L(\hat{y}, y) = -[y \log  \hat{y} + (1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})]$$
$$\text{The single update step } \theta^{t+1} = \theta^{t} - \eta \nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y) $$



\begin{enumerate}
	\item (4 pts) Compute the first gradient $\nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y)$.
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	Noticed: $\frac{d \sigma(z)}{dz} = \sigma(z)(1-\sigma(z))$\\
	\begin{align*}
	\nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y) &= - [ \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta } y \cdot log \sigma(\theta^T x) +  \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta } (1-y) log (1 - \sigma(\theta^T x))]\\
	&= - [ \frac{y}{\sigma(\theta^T x)} \cdot \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta } \sigma(\theta^T x) +  \frac{1-y}{1 - \sigma(\theta^T x)} \cdot \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta } (1 - \sigma(\theta^T x))]\\
	&= - [ \frac{y}{\sigma(\theta^T x)} \cdot \sigma(\theta^T x)(1-\sigma(\theta^T x)) \cdot \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta } \theta^T x +  \frac{y-1}{1 - \sigma(\theta^T x)} \cdot \sigma(\theta^T x)(1-\sigma(\theta^T x)) \cdot \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta } \theta^T x]\\
	&= - [ y(1-\sigma(\theta^T x)) \cdot x +  (y-1) \sigma(\theta^T x) \cdot x]\\
	&= - [ y (1- \hat{y}) \cdot x + (y-1) \hat{y} \cdot x]\\
	&= - (y - \hat{y}) \cdot x = ( \sigma(\theta^T x) - y) \cdot x
	\end{align*}
	\end{soln}
	
	\item (4 pts)
 Now assume a two dimensional input. After including a bias parameter for the first dimension, we will have $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^3$.
$$ \text{Initial parameters : }  \theta^{0}=[0, 0, 0]$$
$$ \text{Learning rate }\eta=0.1$$
$$ \text{data example : } x=[1, 3, 2], y=1$$
Compute the updated parameter vector $\theta^{1}$ from the single update step.
	
	\begin{soln}\\
	From part (a), we know that $\nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y) = ( \sigma(\theta^T x) - y) \cdot x$. Therefore, we can compute the updated parameter vector $\theta^{1}$ from the single update step as following:\\
	\begin{align*}
	\theta^{1} &= \theta^{0} - \eta \nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y)\\
	&= \theta^0 - \eta (y - \sigma(\theta^T x)) \cdot x\\
	&= [0, 0, 0] - 0.1 ( \sigma([0, 0, 0]^T [1, 3, 2])-1) \cdot [1, 3, 2]\\
	&= [0, 0, 0] - 0.1 ( \sigma(0)-1) \cdot [1, 3, 2]\\
	&= [0, 0, 0] - 0.1 ( 0.5- 1 ) \cdot [1, 3, 2]\\
	&= [0, 0, 0] + 0.1 \cdot 0.5 \cdot [1, 3, 2]\\
	&= [0.05, 0.15, 0.1]\\
	\end{align*}
	\end{soln}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Programming (50 pts)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item (10 pts) Use the whole D2z.txt as training set.  Use Euclidean distance (i.e. $A=I$).
	Visualize the predictions of 1NN on a 2D grid $[-2:0.1:2]^2$.
	That is, you should produce test points whose first feature goes over $-2, -1.9, -1.8, \ldots, 1.9, 2$, so does the second feature independent of the first feature.
	You should overlay the training set in the plot, just make sure we can tell which points are training, which are grid.
